# Bluetooth BLE

This page mirrors the documentation found in [Walker73's Github Wiki](https://github.com/AxelFougues/Walker73/wiki) . It details the protocol used to communicate with the [Comodule Display](/components/electrical/display) in order to retrieve information from the bike, apply settings and update the firmware.

This is very much a work in progress and new information will be added as it is uncovered.
