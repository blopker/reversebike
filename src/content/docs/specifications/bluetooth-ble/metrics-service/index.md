## Characteristics

| Name | UUID | Description | Read | Write | Notify | Indicate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UUID\_CHARACTERISTIC\_REGISTER\_ID | 00001564-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123 | Register a notification id for reading | Y | Y | N | N |
| UUID\_CHARACTERISTIC\_REGISTER | 0000155f-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123 | Read last registered notification | Y | Y | N | N |
| UUID\_CHARACTERISTIC\_REGISTER\_NOTIFIER | 0000155e-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123 | Subscribe to all notifications | Y | N | Y | N |

## Usecase

The metrics service is used to retrieve data about the bike and be notified when the data changes.

Subscribe to ```UUID_CHARACTERISTIC_REGISTER_NOTIFIER``` to receive notifications when values change.

Write a 2-byte identifier to ```UUID_CHARACTERISTIC_REGISTER_ID``` and then read ```UUID_CHARACTERISTIC_REGISTER``` to get the data at any time.

Values can be changed by writing to ```UUID_CHARACTERISTIC_REGISTER```.

## Known register & notification IDs

(1) Flickers between 0x4E and 0x4D when motor is running

 (2) Seems related to pedalling torque

## Known register-only IDs

These were found by brute-force registering ids (0x00 0x00 to 0x09 0x09).

Only the following ones returned a corresponding register.

| Name | ID 0 | ID 1 | Data 2 | Data 3 | Data 4 | Data 5 | Data 6 | Data 7 | Data 8 | Data 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unknown | 0x00 | 0x01 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 |
|  | ... | ... |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Unknown | 0x00 | 0x06 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 |

## Known writable IDs

New writable IDs were found brute-force writing ```UUID_CHARACTERISTIC_REGISTER``` with IDs (0x00 0x00 to 0x00 0xFF) and all data bytes at 0x00. Listed IDs produce a 3-0 notification when written:

| Name | ID 0 | ID 1 | Data 2 | Data 3 | Data 4 | Data 5 | Data 6 | Data 7 | Data 8 | Data 9 |
