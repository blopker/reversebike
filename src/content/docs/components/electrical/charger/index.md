### Modification

A guide for modifying the charger, and optionally the battery itself, to work with [Grin Technologies Cycle Satiator](https://ebikes.ca/product-info/grin-products/cycle-satiator.html): <https://www.reddit.com/r/Super73/comments/invi7q/upgrading_to_a_better_charger_a_guide/>

There's a relevant quote in the guide regarding the center pin:

We only want the red and black to be terminated properly as the Yellow Signal wire is not really used for anything inside the battery pack itself.
